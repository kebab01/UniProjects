# Bitcoin Block Hash

This was my solution from a question in Assignment 4 in the subject "Introduction to Web Technology". The task was to create a webpage that can retreive information about a bitcoin block hash and display it to the user using the [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) library. I received 100% for this assignment
